## üèÜ Project Overview

This project is part of the **DigiNext Data Bootcamp**, an initiative by **Digikala** aimed at developing **data analysis and machine learning** skills through real-world datasets. Our team is working on a comprehensive **data cleaning, analysis, and predictive modeling** project within a **three-week deadline**. The goal is to take a raw dataset and turn it into actionable insights.

## üî• Project Challenges

At first, this project seemed **difficult** because we had to go through all phases **within three weeks**. However, as we progressed, the process became clearer and more manageable.

Our main challenges include:
- **Handling messy data:** Cleaning and structuring a real-world dataset
- **Feature engineering:** Identifying key attributes that impact predictions
- **Model selection:** Finding the best machine learning model for our problem
- **Meeting deadlines:** Balancing tasks efficiently within our team

## üìå Project Workflow

The project follows a structured workflow:

```mermaid
graph TD;
  A[Raw Dataset] -->|Data Cleaning| B(Preprocessing);
  B -->|Feature Engineering| C(Exploratory Data Analysis);
  C -->|Statistical Insights| D(Model Selection);
  D -->|Training & Validation| E(Performance Evaluation);
  E -->|Fine-Tuning| F(Deployment & Documentation);
```

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Data Collection & Cleaning**
- Removed duplicates and irrelevant columns
- Fixed missing values using **mean imputation** and **mode replacement**
- Standardized numerical values and handled **outliers**

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- Generated **statistical summaries**
- Used **boxplots, histograms, and scatter plots** to visualize trends
- Found correlations between **key features**

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Feature Engineering & Selection**
- Converted categorical variables using **one-hot encoding**
- Applied **scaling techniques** for uniformity
- Identified the most **influential variables** for prediction

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ **Model Training & Optimization**
- Tested multiple **machine learning models** (Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, XGBoost)
- Used **cross-validation** for better performance
- Optimized hyperparameters with **GridSearchCV**

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ **Results & Deployment**
- Evaluated performance using **MSE, RMSE, and R¬≤ scores**
- Compared models using **confusion matrices and accuracy scores**
- Deployed the best-performing model
